# PSReliP
**Population Structure and Relatedness integrated Pipeline** <br>
The integrated pipeline for analysis and visualization of population structure and relatedness based on genome-wide genetic variant data <br>
## Features
- Quality control and filtering of samples and variants;
- Calculation of basic sample statistics, such as the types of observed variants, inbreeding coefficients and some others, performed before and after data filtering;
- Analysis of population stratification using PCA and MDS, and if it is selected, complete-linkage hierarchical clustering of samples based on IBS distance matrix;
- Calculation of Wright's fixation index (FST);
- Calculation of IBS distance matrix and analysis of genetic relatedness by estimating KING kinship coefficient matrix and genomic relationship matrix (GRM);
